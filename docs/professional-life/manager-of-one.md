# Manager of one

The concept of being a "manager of one" was introduced by 37signals,
and is discussed in detail on the [signalvvoice page](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one).

## Self-oriented professional

The text highlight the following:

> _"A manager of one is someone who comes up with their own goals and executes them.
They don’t need heavy direction"._

Be manager of yourself in my experience is a definition of freedom,
This does not imply irresponsibility, but rather highlights of the importance of autonomy and self-management.

Additionally, self-awareness is crucial for making informed decisions
about where to focus your effort and how to engage effectively.

## More action, less speech

> _"How can you spot these people? Look at their history.
Have they been self-sufficient at previous jobs?
Have they defined their own role before?"_

I see more value on how people act upon certain situation
rather than their knowledge or opinions of a knowledge area.

One example: How did they react during that project
when no one took the initiative to help?
I am not referring to fully resolving the issue.
but rather to the level of interest someone showed
in engaging with the situation at work.
